# Retro Flavored Jam Submission

I found jam around homebrew dev that gives me a month to make something. It's ambitious, but I need to try. There's another jam at the same time that I'll probably submit this same project for as well.

*November 1 - 30, 2024*

## Game synopsis

Theme: **TBD**

Although, not ideal for a real game, I am going to take whatever theme the jam throws at me, and try to wrap it in a sports game. In the future, I'd love to make a hockey or boxing/MMA game of some sorts, and I might as well start building a foundation now. This game *will* suck. But I want to make the graphics as well as some mechanic that at least resembles the sport mixed with the theme.

Console: **Gameboy**

As much as I've been really immersed in the world of PlayStation One development lately, I do not possess the skills to make a game true to the PSX art style in a one-month span. I don't really care about the judging, but part of the fun of the jam is trying to follow the criteria. I'd like to work with art that fits the context of the console, and for now that's the *Gameboy* or *Gameboy Color*. The GB/GBA will always keep a special place in my childhood as I spent tons of time playing on my hand-me-down as a kid. The GB dev community is relatively large and the toolchains are easy enough to work with. I'd like to start and finish something on the Gameboy in one month for this jam.

## Gameplay

This may change when the theme is announced, but I'd like to attempt to make a 2D hockey game resembling the retro games of the time period like [Blades of Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blades_of_Steel) or [Ice Hockey (NES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Hockey_(1988_video_game)). This involves a somewhat top-down view of the ice as well as 2D sprites for the players, puck and goal-net. 

For a minimum viable submission, version 0.1, I intend on setting the player 1-on-1 against the computer opponent with goalies following similar controls to Blades of Steel. As much as I would like to implement a full 5 vs 5 mode, that may not be realistic in this time frame.
